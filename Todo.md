# TODO

* Sane defaults. Maybe a RGBLED.scan to find correct USB device? Or some kind of device reporter?
* i2c support
* ATTiny support? Much cheaper than ATMega. Must have 3 digital outputs with PWM support
* Custom colors for each state for RSpec formatter
* Other test suite formatters
* Use GPL? Look into other licenses
* Tests! Oh the irony..
* Remove `pry` dependency
